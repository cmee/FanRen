    /// handler can use the movement controller without actually adding it to
    /// RPGCharacterController. This keeps the character controller independent of
    /// RPGMovementController.
    ///
    /// The movement controller can only be in one of its movement states at any given time
    /// (Move, Jump, Swim, etc.), and the start/end logic is mostly taken care of in the movement
    /// controller itself.
